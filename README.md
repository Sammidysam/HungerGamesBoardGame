HungerGamesBoardGame
====================

My first game ever.  Programmed in Java!  The code is currently really bad but in the future it will get better - I will add the library Slick2d for graphics eventually.

I also created a .zip for the soundtrack of the game.  It's not an original soundtrack made just for the game, but it's decent:
